window object:
The topmost object in the BOM is the window object representing the window or tab or an iframe sometimes. Window object has properties like browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen etc. In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.
Document Object Model:
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element that represents the html document.
